I do believe that Mahler's Sixth symphony is - if not THE peak - one of the peaks of post-romantic orchestral music.

Personally, I struggle to find the words to describe the shock that this music causes me psychologically: it's like a tornado that sucks me in, shakes me for an hour and a half, and then leaves me alone and exhausted on a livid coast.

But, together with the unique experience of a prolonged shaking of the emotional sphere, you also realize the greatness of this tornado, that is, what Mahler managed to unleash. These emotions were condensed into a few seconds by Claudio Abbado at the end of the symphony at the @LucerneFestival in 2006: loneliness and terror -- exhaustion of vital energy, and finally the silent communion between human beings who witnessed a manifestation of genius.
