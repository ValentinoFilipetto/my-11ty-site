> If you ask me if I think I understand Bruckner I will answer yes, but what do I do? A hole in the water! The world does not live to my own criteria. At the contrary: it goes passionately against everything I appreciate about music. <cite>Sergiu Celibidache</cite>

> To him, time is different than it is to other composers. To a normal man, time is what comes after the beginning. To Bruckner, time is what comes after the end. All his apotheotical finals, the hope for another world, the hope of being saved, of being again baptised in light. It exists nowhere else. <cite>Sergiu Celibidache</cite>

For Celibidache, music in its true, profound and final expression is not an object of thought. Music can be analysed and cognitively learned: given a piece, we can highlight a modulation, explain its form, discuss wether the instrumentation of a passage makes sense or not, but that is not music. We have rehearsals, but "a rehersal is not music", it has nothing to do with music, it is just a endless sequence of "no's": not too loud, not too weak, not so sharp, etc. Indeed that is what we do during a rehersal: we organise the sound material, but music is much more, and most importantly, it has nothing to do with thought, with congnition.

Music is rather something we have to experience, we have to live, just like life, and in fact music and life are one and the same thing ("there is music in each one of us [...] while you shave in the morning you make music"). It does not make sense to ask why music affects us so much because music is not something coming from the outside and that can affect us, because music "is" us. (insert also part on living together).

> I create the spontaneous relation to the piece by reading a Bruckner score that I know by heart! That I could rewrite from memory! So I read it as if never seen before and tell myself: "The horns now! Why the horns?". I react like a child. And I often succeed in eliminating this experience-induced stratification. And I often succeed in creating a spontaenous relation to this great unknown man. <cite>Sergiu Celibidache</cite>
